## sms-spam-detector

* This project uses a dataset of SMS labelled as 'ham' or 'spam' to identify spam.
* The dataset was used to build a model that predicts and classifies SMS as 'ham' or 'spam' using ski-kit learn, and was trained and tested to be validated for accuracy, with the training data having an accuracy of 1.00 and the testing data hacing an accuracy of 0.99.
* This model was then used to build an application using gradio, that contains a textbox for users to enter SMS and another textbox with the output of the 'ham' or 'spam' classification.
* Here is a URL to run the app: <http://127.0.0.1:7867/>
* Here are example text messages to try to input into the app:
